High level bindings to pxtone for Rust

Run `cargo run --release --example full_playback` for a demo.<br>
See [examples/](examples/) for sample code.

This project adds extra layers on top of the original pxtone library in order to provide a more Rust-friendly API.<br>
For low-level bindings, see [rust-pxtone-sys](https://github.com/PieKing1215/rust-pxtone-sys).

The code is structured into an [`interface`](https://github.com/PieKing1215/rust-pxtone/tree/master/src/pxtone/interface) module and an [`og_impl`](https://github.com/PieKing1215/rust-pxtone/tree/master/src/pxtone/og_impl) module.<br>The idea is that the `interface` module contains all of the traits and structure that define the API, and the `og_impl` module contains an implementation of these traits using the original pxtone library via [rust-pxtone-sys](https://github.com/PieKing1215/rust-pxtone-sys).<br>
(The `og_impl` module is controlled by the feature "og-impl" which is on by default)<br>
The hope is that in the future, this will allow building a custom, entirely Rust implementation of pxtone which can implement this interface, making the backend interchangeable (though work has not started on this custom backend yet).
